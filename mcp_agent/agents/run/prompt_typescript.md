## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Find every config for the MCP server
  - take a look at argv usage
  - take a look at process.env usage
  - name of the config is the argv or environment variable in camelCase
  - Mark credentials with secret: true
  - Best way to find it: read README.md, main code file (index.ts), .env.sample
  - Include optional environments also
  - config key must be environment variable in camelCase
2. Find entrypoint
  - read package.json file
  - Only use 'node' as first argument
  - Include 'argv' field for command line arguments
  - best way to find entrypoint is to look at "bin" in package.json
  - if you did not find "bin" then take a look at "start"
