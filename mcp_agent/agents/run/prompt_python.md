## Input JSON schema
{input}

## Output JSON schema
```json
{output}
```

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Find every config for the MCP server
  - take a look at parser.add_argument usage
  - take a look at os.environ or os.getenv usage
  - name of the config is the parser.add_argument or environment variable in camelCase
  - Mark credentials with secret: true
  - Best way to find it: read README.md, main code file can be found in pyproject.toml
  - Include optional environments also
  - config key must be environment variable in camelCase
2. Find the entrypoint
  - read pyproject.toml and find [project.scripts], if you find it then command should translate to: ["uv", "run", "SCRIPT_VALUE"]
  - for argv interpret all parser.add_argument from configuration you have in config, it should include --name-args $value
