description: Retrieve web pages, news, and local business results via Brave API.
longDescription: This Brave Search MCP server, developed by ModelContextProtocol,
  integrates the Brave Search API to provide web and local search capabilities for
  AI assistants. It offers flexible querying options including pagination, result
  filtering, and content freshness controls. The implementation handles API authentication
  and exposes Brave's search functionality through a standardized MCP interface. By
  bridging AI models and Brave's privacy-focused search engine, this server enables
  AI systems to retrieve relevant web pages, news articles, and local business information.
  It is particularly useful for AI assistants needing to gather up-to-date information
  from the web, conduct research, or provide location-based recommendations while
  respecting user privacy.
