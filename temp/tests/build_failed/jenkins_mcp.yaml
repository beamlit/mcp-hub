longDescription: 'Jenkins MCP is a server that enables managing Jenkins operations
  such as listing jobs, triggering builds, and checking build statuses through a configurable

  ''list_jobs'', ''trigger_build'', and ''get_build_status''. The server is remote-capable
  and can be configured using a JSON schema for Jenkins server details.
