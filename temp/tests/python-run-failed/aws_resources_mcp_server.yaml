longDescription: 'The AWS Resources MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
  implementation that provides the ability to run generated Python code to query any
  AWS resources through boto3. It allows users to perform management operations based
  on their AWS user role permissions. The server is designed to run directly from
  a Docker image, making it easy for Python developers to contribute and maintain.
  It includes proper sandboxing for code execution and keeps everything containerized
  and clean. The server exposes a dynamic resource `aws://query_resources` for accessing
  AWS resources through boto3 queries. It supports executing AWS queries using a tool
  called `query_aws_resources`, which allows users to input Python code snippets to
  query AWS resources.
