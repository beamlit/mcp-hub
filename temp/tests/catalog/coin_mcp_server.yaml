longDescription: 'Coin MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol server that provides
  access to CoinMarketCap''s cryptocurrency data. This server enables AI-powered applications
  to retrieve cryptocurrency listings, quotes, and detailed information about various
  coins. It offers tools such as `listing-coins`, `get-coin-info`, and `get-coin-quotes`
  to fetch market data, detailed coin information, and latest quotes. The server requires
  a CoinMarketCap API key to function, which can be provided as an environment variable
  or command-line argument. Contributions to expand and improve the server are welcome.
