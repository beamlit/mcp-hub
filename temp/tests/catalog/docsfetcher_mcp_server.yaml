longDescription: 'The DocsFetcher MCP Server is designed to fetch and extract comprehensive
  package documentation from various programming language ecosystems such as JavaScript,
  Python, and Java. It is particularly useful for large language models (LLMs) like
  Claude, as it provides access to structured documentation data without the need
  for API keys. This server supports multiple tools including ''fetch-url-docs'',
  ''fetch-package-docs'', ''fetch-library-docs'', and ''fetch-multilingual-docs'',
  making it a versatile solution for developers seeking to enhance their development
  experience with easy access to documentation.
