description: Test protocol features and tools for client compatibility.
longDescription: This MCP server, developed by Anthropic, serves as a comprehensive
  demo suite for MCP client implementations. It exercises the full range of MCP protocol
  features including prompts, tools, resources, and sampling. Built in TypeScript,
  the server implements various tools like echo, math operations, and LLM sampling,
  as well as 100 test resources in both plaintext and binary formats. By providing
  a standardized testing ground, this server enables MCP client developers to validate
  their implementations against a wide array of protocol functionalities. It is particularly
  useful for ensuring compatibility, debugging edge cases, and demonstrating the capabilities
  of the MCP protocol in a controlled environment.
