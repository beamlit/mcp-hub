*** VERY IMPORTANT*** CLONE THE REPOSITORY IN TMP FOLDER AND ANALYZE CONTENT


## Find icon and metadata
### Guidelines
- path is where the content is interesting
- Extract README.md content, figure out categories and website from the content
- Generate a description and a long description for this hub
- Limit to 3 or 4 categories, category should be in lowercase
- Retrieve icon from github on repository organization "https://avatars.githubusercontent..."
- branch => execute command git branch --show-current | cat

Give me all the output in this format, it should be written in hub/${NAME}.yml
```yaml
repository: REPOSITORY
displayName: DISPLAY_NAME
description: DESCRIPTION
longDescription: LONG_DESCRIPTION
url: WEBSITE
icon: ICON
branch: DEFAULT_BRANCH
githubStar: GITHUB_STAR_NUMBER
download: DONWLOAD
categories:
  - category1
  - category2
```

## Figure out the language of the repository
Give me all the output in this format, in lowercase. It should be written in hub/${NAME}.yml
```yaml
language: LANGUAGE
```

## Run configuration
- Figure out the basePath, for instance take a look at hub/sequentialthinking or hub/postgres.yaml. It is not the path of the directory cloned. It is the path inside the repository that you must run command from
- Figure out the srcPath, it can be at the root level, but most of the times it is in src, src/MCP_NAME...
- For typescript I need to know the distPath. Generally it is in dist or build folder
- For python I need to know the entrypoint, generally it is found inside pyproject.toml, for example take a look at hub/discord.yaml or hub/snowflake.yaml
Give me all the output in this format. It should be written in hub/${NAME}.yml
```yaml
basePath: BASE_PATH (only if necessary, not .)
srcPath: SRC_PATH
distPath: DIST_PATH (only in typescript)
entrypoint: ENTRYPOINT (only in python)
```

## Generate smithery config
Find every config for the MCP server
  - leave command in commandFunction empty, it is handled in Dockerfile
  - args in commandFunction are only for command line argv or argparse
  - take a look at argv (Typescript) or argparse (Python) usage
  - take a look at process.env (Typescript) or os.environ (Python) usage
  - name of the config is the argv or environment variable in camelCase
  - Mark credentials should be put to secret for security reason
  - Best way to find it: read README.md, main code file (index.ts), .env.sample
  - Include optional environments also
  - config key must be environment variable in camelCase

### Very important do not add properties you did not find in the repository. It can be empty

Give me all the output in this format. It should be written in hub/${NAME}.yml
```yaml
secrets:
  - secretNumberOne
smithery:
  startCommand:
    type: stdio or sse
    configSchema:
      # JSON Schema defining the configuration options for the MCP.
      type: object
      required:
        - secretNumberOne
      properties:
        configNumberOne:
          type: string
          description: A small description of the configuration
        secretNumberOne:
          type: string
          description: A small description of the secret
    commandFunction:
      # A function that produces the CLI command to start the MCP on stdio.
      |-
      config=>({command:'',args:[],env:{CONFIG_NUMBER_ONE:config.configNumberOne, SECRET_NUMBER_ONE: config.secretNumberOne}})
```

Now remove useless spaces in the YAML file

## Create test file

- Create a test file: hack/test_client/src/configs/config.context7.ts
```ts
export const payload: ((previousResult: Record<string, any>) => {
  name: string;
  arguments: Record<string, any>;
})[] = [];

export const description = "DESCRIPTION";
export const name = "NAME";
export const url = "http://localhost:8080";
```

Add fake environment variable in .env file into root directory
Add some documentation also
